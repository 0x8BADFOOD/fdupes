Adrian Bridgett <adrian.bridgett@iname.com>:
   - Provided the original version of the fdupes manpage.
   - Suggested comparing file sizes before calling
     md5sum program (big performance boost).

Steven S. Dick <ssd@nevets.oau.org>:
   - Provided patch for better handling of extremely long 
     input on preserve prompt (author's note: modified
     Steven's patch to handle input a bit differently).

Frank DENIS aka Jedi/Sector One aka DJ Chrysalis <j@4u.net>:
   - Provided patch to fix bug where program would crash when
     files being scanned were named pipes or sockets.
   - Warned against security risk resulting from the use of a
     temporary file to store md5sum output. Suggested the use 
     of RSARef instead of md5sum (author's note: used L. Peter 
     Deutsch's MD5 message digest library instead of RSARef).
   - Provided patch to fix problem where false duplicates would
     be reported because of hard links. Unlike the symlinks
     issue described in the documentation, these false
     reports are not a threat to the data, just the link.
     (author's note: modified patch for correctness).

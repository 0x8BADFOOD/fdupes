- Find a way to discard extra input on the "preserve" prompt. As 
  of this moment, if the user enters more information than is
  actually read by the fgets function, the next fgets call will 
  retrieve the extra data, which is misinterpreted by the program 
  as being the next "preserve list". This can be potentially
  dangerous, but I can't find a way to fix it (fflush doesn't
  seem to work for input streams). As the program is currently
  written, fgets will read up to 256 characters times the
  maximum number of duplicates found in a particular run.

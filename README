Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------
FDUPES is a program for identifying duplicate files residing
within specified directories. 


Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: fdupes [options] <DIRECTORY> [DIRECTORY]...

 -r --recurse	include files residing in subdirectories
 -q --quiet  	hide progress indicator
 -1 --sameline	list duplicates on a single line
 -s --symlinks	follow symlinks
 -d --delete  	prompt user for files to preserve and delete all others
              	important: using this option together with -s or --symlinks
              	or when specifiying the same directory more than once
              	can lead to accidental data loss
 -v --version 	display fdupes version
 -h --help   	display this help message

Unless -1 or --sameline is specified, duplicate files are listed 
together in groups, each file displayed on a separate line. The
groups are then separated from each other by blank lines.

When using -d or --delete, care should be taken to insure against
accidental data loss. While no information will be immediately
lost, using the -s or --symlink option or specifying a certain 
directory more than once can lead to confusing information
being presented to the user when prompted for files to preserve.
When using options -s or --symlyink, a user could accidentally 
preserve a symlink while deleting the file it points to.
Furthermore, when specifying a particular directory more than
once, all files within that directory will be listed as their 
own duplicates, leading to data loss should a user preserve a 
file without its "duplicate" (the file itself!).


Requirements
